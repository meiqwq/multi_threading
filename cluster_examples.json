        "\n\nA: Use this. Made a little change in your code. Extend Activity instead of ActionBarActivity. 'Activity' is the superclass of all. No need to import : \"android.support.v7.app.ActionBarActivity;\".\nYour MainActivity.java file:\npackage com.example.helloworld;\n\nimport android.app.Activity;\nimport android.os.Bundle;\nimport android.view.MenuItem;\nimport android.view.View;\nimport android.widget.TextView;\n\n\npublic class MainActivity extends Activity {\n\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n}\n\n@Override\npublic boolean onOptionsItemSelected(MenuItem item) {\n    // Handle action bar item clicks here. The action bar will\n    // automatically handle clicks on the Home/Up button, so long\n    // as you specify a parent activity in AndroidManifest.xml.\n    int id = item.getItemId();\n    if (id == R.id.action_settings) {\n        return true;\n    }\n    return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item);\n}\npublic void button_touch(View v)\n{\n    TextView tv = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textView1);\n    tv.setText(\"Hello, world.\");\n\n}\n}\n\nAnd your activity_main.xml is perfect.\nQ: Constructing a map from the 3-sphere to the 2-sphere from a link Edit: As Qiaochu remarks, the following is a special case of the Pontryagin-Thom construction. It's done wrong, though, because the framing of links is being ignored. If nobody beats me to it, I'll write an answer clarifying these points soon.\nThe Whitehead product $\\pi_2(X,x_0)\\times\\pi_2(X,x_0)\\to\\pi_3(X,x_0)$ is induced by the attaching map ${\\mathbb S}^3\\to{\\mathbb S}^2\\vee{\\mathbb S}^2$ of the $4$-cell in ${\\mathbb S}^2\\times{\\mathbb S}^2$. Writing ${\\mathbb S}^3=\\partial{\\mathbb D}^4$, ${\\mathbb S}^2={\\mathbb D}^2/\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2$, this can be described as $$\\partial{\\mathbb D}^4=\\partial({\\mathbb D}^2\\times{\\mathbb D}^2)=\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2\\times{\\mathbb D}^2\\cup{\\mathbb D}^2\\times\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2\\to {\\mathbb D}^2/\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2\\vee {\\mathbb D}^2/\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2.$$\nNow, the 4-cube / tesseract $\\partial {\\mathbb D}^4$ can be visualized as  where the missing 8-th cube has the same vertices as the outer cube in the picture, but with disjoint interior. Alternatively, one might think of it as stretching out to infinity, filling the entire 3-space, plus the point at infinity.\nIn that picture, the map ${\\mathbb S}^3\\to{\\mathbb S}^2\\vee{\\mathbb S}^2$ seems to be obtained as follows: Take the four'middle' cubes horizontally circulating around the small inner cube. Together they form a solid torus ${\\mathbb D}^2\\times{\\mathbb S}^1$ which can be projected onto ${\\mathbb S}^2={\\mathbb D}^2/\\partial{\\mathbb D}^2$. Similarly, looking at the remaining four cubes, stretching'vertically' (including the outer 'infinite' cube), they constitute a solid torus, too, again mapping into ${\\mathbb S}^2$. These two maps glue to give a map ${\\mathbb S}^3\\to{\\mathbb S}^2\\vee{\\mathbb S}^2$.\nThe essence of this construction is the Hopf link immersed into ${\\mathbb S}^3$, representing the two knotted tori. In fact, it seems that any embedding of a $k$-component link $L$ into ${\\mathbb S}^3$ would give a map ${\\mathbb S}^3\\to {\\mathbb S}^{2}\\vee\\ldots\\vee{\\mathbb S}^2$, with $k$ copies of ${\\mathbb S}^2$ appearing on the RHS. Composing with the folding map ${\\mathbb S}^{2}\\vee\\ldots\\vee{\\mathbb S}^2\\to{\\mathbb S}^2$ gives a map $\\varphi_L: {\\mathbb S}^3\\to {\\mathbb S}^2$, the homotopy class of which only depends on the homotopy class of the link $L$.\n\nQuestions: Provided all this make sense so far, I"

        " Gajasura, assuming, at the same time, the appearance of a flutist. The enchanting performance of the bull sent the asura into ecstasies, and he asked the flutist to tell him what he desired. The musical Vishnu responded: \"Can you give me that which I ask?\" Gajasura replied: \"Who do you take me for? I can immediately give you whatever you ask.\" The flutist then said: \"If that's so, liberate Shiva from your stomach.\" Gajasura understood then that this must have been no other than Vishnu himself, the only one who could have known that secret and he threw himself at his feet. Having agreed to liberate Shiva, Gajasura asks him for two last gifts: \"I have been blessed by you with many gifts; my last requests are that everyone should remember me adoring my head and you should wear my skin.\"\n\nGaze of Shani \nA lesser known story from the Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates a different version of Ganesha's birth. On the insistence of Shiva, Parvati fasted for years (punyaka vrata) to propitiate Vishnu so that he would grant her a son. Vishnu, after the completion of the sacrifice, announced that he would incarnate himself as her son in every kalpa (eon). Accordingly, Ganesha was born to Parvati as a charming infant. This event was celebrated with great enthusiasm and all the gods were invited to take a look at the baby. However Shani (Saturn), the son of Surya, hesitated to look at the baby since Shani was cursed with the gaze of destruction. Shani came to a decision and looked at the goddess Parvati's baby from the edge of his left eye. However Parvati insisted that he look at the baby, which Shani did, and immediately the infant's head fell off. Seeing Shiva and Parvati grief-stricken, Vishnu mounted on Garuda, his divine eagle, and rushed to the banks of the Pushpa-Bhadra river, from where he brought back the head of a young elephant. The head of the elephant was joined with the headless body of Parvati's son, thus reviving him. The infant was named Ganesha and all the Gods blessed Ganesha and wished Him power and prosperity.\n\nOther versions \n\nAnother tale of Ganesha's birth relates to an incident in which Shiva unknowingly slew Aditya (Surya). Shiva restored life to the dead boy, but this could not pacify the outraged sage Kashyapa, who was one of the seven great Rishis. Kashyapa cursed Shiva and declared that Shiva's son would lose his head. When this happened, the head of Indra's elephant was used to replace it.\n\nStill another tale states that on one occasion, Parvati's used bath-water was thrown into the Ganges, and this water was drunk by the elephant-headed goddess Malini, who gave birth to a baby with four arms and five elephant heads. The river goddess Ganga claimed him as her son, but Shiva declared him to be Parvati's son, reduced his five heads to one and enthroned him as the controller of obstacles (Vignesha).\n\nBroken tusk \n\nThere are various anecdotes which explain how Ganesha broke off one of his right tusks. Devotees sometimes say that his single tusk indicates his ability to overcome all forms of dualism. In India, an elephant with one tusk is sometimes called a \"Ganesh\".\n\nGanesha the scribe \nIn the first part of the epic poem Mahabharata, it is written that the sage Vyasa () asked Ganesha to transcribe the poem as he dictated it to him. Ganesha agreed, but only on the condition that Vyasa recite the poem uninterrupted, without pausing. The sage, in his turn, posed the condition that Ganesha would not only have to write, but would have to understand everything that he heard before writing it down. In this way, Vyasa might recuperate a bit from his continuous talking by simply reciting a difficult verse which Ganesha could not understand. The dictation began, but in the rush of writing Ganesha's feather pen broke. He broke off a tusk and used it as a pen so that the transcription could proceed without interruption, permitting him to keep his word.\n\nThis is the single passage in which Ganesha appears in that epic. The story is not accepted as part of the original text by the editors of the critical edition of the Mahabharata, where the twenty-line story is relegated to"

        " scripts tags I am so new to the world of API calling and apparently there is a script called in post API that is not letting me call them properly please see this link:\nhttps://acciers.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/?app=3\nHow can I remove this script tag from this file?\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            window._nslDOMReady = function (callback) {\n                if ( document.readyState === \"complete\" || document.readyState === \"interactive\" ) {\n                    callback();\n                } else {\n                    document.addEventListener( \"DOMContentLoaded\", callback );\n                }\n            };\n            </script><script type='text/javascript' src='https://acciers.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.min.js?ver=3.6.0' id='jquery-core-js'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://acciers.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=3.3.2' id='jquery-migrate-js'></script>\n\nQ: Perl - Schedule from text I'm currently reading in a text file containing the following lines:\n0 24000 97200\n1 52200 95400\n2 0 0\n3 37800 180000\n4 0 0\n5 48000 95400\n6 0 0\nThe first value represents the day (0 = sunday, 1 = monday,...)\nThe numeric values, e.g. 24000, represent the total amount of seconds.\nEventually I would like to get something like this:\n\nThis is the code so far: \nopen(SCHEDULE, $schedule) or die print \"Failed to open $schedule\";\n@lines = <SCHEDULE>;\n@secondsfrom  = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0);\n@secondsto    = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0);\n@secondsextra = (0,0,0,0,0,0,0);\n@days = (\"sunday\",\"monday\",\"tuesday\",\"wedsneday\",\"thursday\",\"friday\",\"saturday\");\nforeach (@lines) {\n    ($day, $fromtotalseconds, $tototalseconds) = split(/ /,$_,3);\n    @secondsfrom[$day] += $fromtotalseconds;\n    @secondsto[$day]   += $tototalseconds;\n}\nfor (my $i=0; $i<=6;$i++) {\n    print \"\\n@days[$i]  @secondsfrom[$i] to @secondsto[$i]\";\n}\n\nAt this moment I'm stuck! I've been searching for days on how to convert these values to something similar like: \nSunday from 24000 to 86400 (MAX) \nTuesday from 0 to 48000 and from 52200 to 86400\n\u2026\nThis is what it produces for me: \nSunday 24000 to        97200\nTuesday 52200 to        95400\n\u2026\n\nA: Here is a textual implementation. I did not really check it for correctness, so there might be bugs lurking in it, but it should illustrate how to deal with the input one line at a time:\n#!/usr/bin/env perl\n\nuse strict; use warnings;\n\nuse constant ONE_MINUTE => 60;\nuse constant ONE_HOUR   => 60 * ONE_MINUTE;\nuse constant ONE_DAY    => 24 * ONE_HOUR;\nuse constant BLOCK_SIZE => ONE_MINUTE * 20;\nuse constant DAY_LENGTH => ONE_DAY/BLOCK_SIZE;\n\nmy @days = qw(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat);\n\nmy $remainder = 0;\n\nwhile (my $line = <DATA>) {\n    next unless $line =~ m{\n        \\A\n        ( [0-6]  ) \\s+\n        ( [0-9]+ ) \\s+\n        ( [0-9]+ ) \\s+\n        \\z\n    }x;\n    my ($daynum, $start, $duration) = ($1, $2, $3);\n    my $start_block = seconds_to_blocks($start);\n    my $duration_block = seconds_to_blocks($duration);\n\n    my ($dayrow, $hang) = make_dayrow(\n        $remainder,\n        $start_block,\n        $duration_block,\n    );\n\n    "

Di conseguenza, gli investigatori hanno affermato che Smith e Hickock rimangono ancora due possibili sospettati.\n\nNel 2017, il The Wall Street Journal ha scoperto un documento scritto a mano che Hickock redasse durante il periodo in cui attendeva la sua esecuzione nel braccio della morte. Il manoscritto, a quanto si dice intitolato The High Road to Hell (\"La strada per l'inferno\") presumibilmente ha fatto luce sul movente dietro gli omicidi, che ancora oggi \u00e8 oggetto di dibattito. Prima della sua esecuzione, Hickock aveva insistito, con la conferma anche da parte di Smith, sul fatto che quest'ultimo avesse commesso tutti gli omicidi. Hickock descrive infatti come avesse illuminato con una torcia ciascuna delle quattro teste dei Clutter mentre Smith sparava; l'unico rimpianto di Hickock era che Smith avesse commesso tutte le uccisioni, mentre lui nessuna. Nel discutere il suo presunto movente, Hickock afferm\u00f2 di aver commesso gli omicidi in cambio di 5\u00a0000 dollari da parte di un uomo di nome Roberts, scrivendo: \"Stavo per uccidere una persona. Forse pi\u00f9 di uno. Potrei farlo? Forse torner\u00f2 indietro. Ma non posso tirarmi indietro, ho preso i soldi. Ne ho spesa una parte. Inoltre, pensavo, so troppo.\" Per tutto il 1961, Hickock invi\u00f2 il manoscritto al reporter Mack Nations, che aveva promesso di usarlo per un libro. Dopo aver completato il progetto, Nations ha inviato il manoscritto alla casa editrice Random House, che per\u00f2 lo sped\u00ec indietro facendo sapere che avevano gi\u00e0 incaricato Capote di scrivere sugli omicidi dei Clutter.\n\nLo scrittore Kevin Helliker del Journal ha ipotizzato che Hickock avrebbe potuto mentire patologicamente o inventare particolari di fantasia nel suo manoscritto, sostenendo che se la storia di Hickock fosse stata vera, lui e Smith probabilmente avrebbero usato questa informazione per cercare di negoziare ed evitare la condanna a morte, lasciando le responsabilit\u00e0 su questo Roberts, e lui e Smith non avrebbero faticato a consegnare delle prove se fossero stati effettivamente pagati. Michael Stone, uno psichiatra della Columbia University specializzato nello studio di Smith e Hickock, lesse il manoscritto su richiesta del Journal e dichiar\u00f2: \"Non credo per un solo minuto che siano stati pagati per farlo.\"\n\nRappresentazioni cinematografiche \nHickock \u00e8 stato interpretato da Scott Wilson nell'adattamento cinematografico del 1967 A Sangue Freddo, da Anthony Edwards nell'adattamento della miniserie TV del 1996, da Mark Pellegrino nel film Truman Capote - A sangue freddo del 2005 e da Lee Pace nel film Infamous - Una pessima reputazione del 2006.\n\nNote \n\nPersone giustiziate per impiccagioneLa gara in linea maschile Under-23 dei Campionati del mondo di ciclismo su strada 2018 si \u00e8 svolta il 28 settembre 2018 in Austria, con partenza da Kufstein ed arrivo a Innsbruck, su un percorso di 179,5\u00a0km.

        " good news, most machines are Intel and for most applications shipping smaller amounts of data in ascii format will work.\n\nA: Generally, you need to worry about endianness (byte-order) when you transfer integers larger than a single byte from one computer to another.  In C/C++, this means that if you're sending something like a 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit integer, you need to first convert the integer to network byte order, (also known as Big-Endian).  The computer on the receiving end must then convert the incoming integers to host byte order, which is whatever byte-order the host-machine uses natively.  This is usually done using the htons and ntohs series of library functions, but with the Qt library you can also use the qToBigEndian and qFromBigEndian functions.\nNote that you don't need to worry about endianness when sending ASCII or UTF-8 text, because these formats are composed of sequences of individual bytes, rather than multi-byte data types.\n\nA: Here's a simple test for big endianness, in case you want it:\n// This test assumes an int size of at least 2.\nstatic const int testValue = 1;\n#define is_bigendian() ( ((char)&testValue) == 0 )\nbool CD_is_bigendian(void)\n{\n   return is_bigendian();\n} \n\nA: I know this was answered a long time ago, but I just thought I'd add to it.\nInstead of using the endian conversion functions, you could use the QDataStream functionality (with any QIODevice), which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinion. Of course, that would lock you into using the QDataStream on both the sender and receiver, but it's worth it for that case.\nExample usage, for someone else's sample of sending an image:\nQDataStream & operator<< (QDataStream& stream, const QImage& image);\nQDataStream & operator>> (QDataStream& stream, QImage& image);\n(Both of those are already implemented within Qt.)\nQTcpSocket *tcp =...;\nQImage img =...;\nQDataStream(tcp) << img;\n\nA: Intel CPUs use little endian.  Most everything else is big endian.  The default network byte order is big endian.\nTo test if endianness is a problem, send the value 0x12345678 and check if it makes it as the same or 0x78563412.  If the value on the receiving computer is the later value, then the endianness is not the same between the two systems.\nCheck this wikipedia article for info on endianness.\nQ: Trouble checking checkbox I have received several reports from people not being able to register on my website due to them not being able to check a checkbox stating they agree to the Terms of Use. Basically, once the checkbox is checked a button is enabled to allow one to continue with registration.\nI've tried myself and a lot of the time, clicking on the actual checkbox doesn't do anything but clicking on the associated label usually does. I've given that as the workaround but I'd really like to have clicking on the actual checkbox work all of the time.\nThe registration page is: http://www.lonelycache.com/Account/GeocachingAuth.aspx\nThe page form has the following for the checkbox (formatted for readability):\n<asp:CheckBox ID=\"AgreeTOUCheckBox\"\n     AutoPostBack=\"true\"\n     runat=\"server\" Text=\"&ensp;I have read and agree to the\"\n     OnCheckedChanged=\"AgreeTOUCheckBox_OnCheckChanged\" />\n\nThe generated html is (formatted for readability):\n<input id=\"MainContent_AgreeTOUCheckBox\" type=\"checkbox\"\n       name=\"ctl00$MainContent$AgreeTOUCheckBox\"\n       onclick=\"javascript:setTimeout(&#39;__doPostBack(\\&#39;ctl00$MainContent$AgreeTOUCheckBox\\&#39;,\\&#39;\\&#39;)&#39;, 0)\"\n/>\n<label for=\"MainContent_AgreeTOUCheckBox\">\u2002I have read and agree to the</label>\n\nAny ideas on what I might do to get this to work consistently?\n\nA: Your checkbox is working fine, it's just hidden behind another panel.  If you click and drag below the checkbox to highlight the page itself, you can see your left footprint panel is hiding most of the checkbox.\nTry clicking just the very right edge of the checkbox and it will work.\nIt's probably",
        " method performs better in regard of pure optimization, the first method  is better if you want to use the fetched data to do something more intresting with it, but if that is for example printing record's from DB and than forgetting, it's not worth the wasted resources.\n\nA: It depends so much about what you really want in your application. If you read mysqli_fetch_assoc will learn about this function is already returning an array, so call to iteration it's dispensable, principally with the order of array (vector, one dimension) is needed, because the function already do it for you, turning the seconde method the best option.\nThe first method is likable if you want to order your array more specifically, multidimensional kind of stuff or turn into an object. \nPS: It's a good practice if your application it's fully OOP implemented, to do first method putting that information into a private var inside class. \nQ: Pass object from ng-repeat when checkbox checked to array How can I pass the object tableSelection[{}]\nI cannot find any way to do this without passing an index, which wont work in this case - I wish to just pass the object\n<tr ng-repeat=\"d in grid.data\" class=\"grid-row selectable\">\n    <td>\n        <input type=\"checkbox\" data-checklist-model=\"grid.tableSection\" data-checklist-value=\"d\"/> \n    </td>\n\nThis code won't pass the object to the array, which is the problem I am trying to solve.\nQ: Cortana keeps launching without me meaning it to On my Windows 10 laptop, something I'm doing on the trackpad keeps inadvertently launching Cortana. I don't get it with an external mouse and there are no buttons on the pad so I'm wondering if it's a gesture recognition thing. It's VERY annoying - especially when I have music on and before I can cancel it it thinks the lyrics are a command and opens Internet Explorer!\nCan anyone help? I don't want to disable Cortana, just stop it doing this one thing!!\n\nA: Without knowing which type of trackpad your laptop has, it's hard to say exactly what gesture is causing it. On my Synaptics trackpad a three finger tap will activate Cortana.\nCommonly, the mouse/trackpad settings are under Control Panel -> Mouse (under \"icons/classic\" view). For Synaptics trackpads, there will be a \"ClickPad\" tab and then a button for \"ClickPad Settings\". This will pop-up a window with options for all the different gestures your pad supports.\nQ: Make flex items wrap after third item on mobile I have set a row of thumbnails using flex and this works fine, they are centered vertically on desktop. How can I have on mobile screen 3 images in the first row and 2 images in the second row? Images in second row should be aligned to the left.\n\n\ndiv {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n}\nimg {\n  padding: 10px 5px;\n  margin: auto;\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {\n  div {\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n}\n<div>\n  <img src=\"http://placehold.it/150/220\" alt=\"\" />\n  <img src=\"http://placehold.it/200/250\" alt=\"\" />\n  <img src=\"http://placehold.it/240/100\" alt=\"\" />\n  <img src=\"http://placehold.it/250/220\" alt=\"\" />\n  <img src=\"http://placehold.it/200/270\" alt=\"\" />\n</div>\n\n\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/akLbzV\n\nA: One thing you can try is to adjust the width of each flex item in your media query, so that three items are forced into the first row, and two items are forced into subsequent rows.\nYou can do this using the flex, flex-basis or width properties. However, width worked best in your code, probably because the image elements have inherent sizing.\nRevised Codepen\n\n\n* { box-sizing: border-box; }\n\ndiv {\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\nimg { padding: 10px 5px; }\n\n@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {\n  div { flex-wrap: wrap;  }\n  img:nth-child(-n + 3) { width: 33.33%; } /* targets"

Please advise what should be the best solution to create a custom binary protocol server. The server should accept the communication from multiple devices via a binary protocol over TCP/IP.\nIs there any already existing server/framework solution available? I.e. is node.js suitable to solve this problem? The preferred solution would be Java oriented.\nThanks in advance!\nUpdate: the binary protocol is required to reduce the amount of communication data. Any text format for the protocol could too verbose. Moreover the protocol for the device is already specified.\n\nA: I implemented such a thing some time ago. I used two standard Java API's for that:\n\n\n*\n\n*java.net package: java.net.ServerSocket and java.net.Socket should be able to address most of your needs.\n\n*java.concurrency package: for each new connection Socket accepted from a ServerSocket instance you may want to move processing of this connection Socket into another thread and start listening for the next connection using blocking ServerSocket.accept() method again - a kind of producer-consumer pattern implementation. It can be done by publishing the Socket for the new connection into a queue, which is then used to feed thread pool and each thread in this thread pool takes care of the actual connection handling. \n\n\nNote: sometimes when you are not sure what kind of conversational pattern is going to happen between client and server (which one if them is expected to send data first over TCP/IP for instance) it does make sense to read data from a Socket and write data into the same Socket in separate threads too.\n\nA: The basic idea would be a combination of java.net Sockets and ServerSockets, threads, and a protocol implementation based on the facilities of DataOutput and DataInput.\nQ: make a side menu type accordion with angular 4 I'm trying to implement an accordion side-menu using Bootstrap but i can't seem to get it right, I imported the bootrap in app.component i can see that it is well imported and the accordion appear just fine, But the sub-menus don't appear, I click on item 1 per exemple it shows in the url as target but nothing is shown.\nThank you. \nthis is the Bootstrap class im based on \"list-group-item\".\n here is an exemple that doesn't collapse under angular \n<div class=\"panel-group\">\n<div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n<div class=\"panel-heading\">\n  <h4 class=\"panel-title\">\n    <a data-toggle=\"collapse\" href=\"#collapse1\">Collapsible list group</a>\n  </h4>\n</div>\n<div id=\"collapse1\" class=\"panel-collapse collapse\">\n  <ul class=\"list-group\">\n    <li class=\"list-group-item\">One</li>\n    <li class=\"list-group-item\">Two</li>\n    <li class=\"list-group-item\">Three</li>\n  </ul>\n  <div class=\"panel-footer\">Footer</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\nQ: Blazor WebAssembly AuthenticationStateProvider not recognizing logged in User upon launch From practice, I believe Microsoft documentation may have it wrong\nExpose the authentication state as a cascading parameter\nWhere it mentions the configuration for CascadingAuthenticationState and AuthorizeRouteView are combined as follows\n<CascadingAuthenticationState>\n<Router AppAssembly=\"@typeof(Program).Assembly\">\n    <Found Context=\"routeData\">\n        <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=\"@routeData\" \n            Default"

        " la base de datos tengo: \n2016-10-31 00:05:10\n\nEn Javascript uso:\nnew Date(Date.parse(obj.hora_inicio)).toUTCString()\n\nEsto me devuelve:\n\n\"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:18:45 GMT\" \n\nBueno creo que va peor la cosa no? realmente estoy confundido.\n\nA: Lamentablemente no se puede cambiar este comportamiento del JavaScript (de manera nativa), el motivo es porque JavaScript tiene 1 sola manera de trabajar las fechas/horas by default (por as\u00ed decirlo).\nLo que ocurre es simplemente que Javascript mira al cambio de hora, calcula la fecha y hora, y luego le pide al sistema operativo para la representaci\u00f3n de esta marca de tiempo en la zona horaria local. \nEl sistema operativo proporciona un servicio para mostrar la hora en la zona horaria local, pero no en otras zonas horarias. Para ello hay que tener en cuenta cosas como el horario de verano... \nComo siempre con la gesti\u00f3n del tiempo, la \u00fanica manera decente de hacer frente a este problema es utilizar una biblioteca dedicada. En Javascript tenemos a Moment.js y Moment.Timezone.js una librer\u00eda que entra a ser la salvadora de los problemas con conflictos de zonas horarias.\nTe dejo un ejemplo:\n\n\nconsole.log((moment('2016-10-31 00:05:10')).format('L'));\nconsole.log((moment('2016-10-31 00:05:10')).format('LL'));\nconsole.log((moment('2016-10-31 00:05:10')).format('LLL'));\nconsole.log((moment('2016-10-31 00:05:10')).format('LLLL'));\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.13.0/moment.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment-timezone/0.5.4/moment-timezone-with-data.min.js\"></script>\n\n\nLo interesante es que si necesitas mandar a otras zonas horarias, puedes hacerlo con facilidad, de la misma manera hacer un formato con las diversas opciones que hay en Moment.JS\nY como dir\u00edamos en Per\u00fa: \"De yapa\" (ref: agregando algo extra)\nEsta librer\u00eda utiliza la norma ISO 8601, donde la fecha se puede definir en un momento preciso (como los cambios de zona horaria +/- 1hora) y por lo tanto se mostrar\u00e1 en todas las zonas horarias que desees. \nQ: GitLab CE keeps resetting my external_url I'm running GitLab CE privately within an AWS VPC that I access via a VPN instance. I installed the latest AWS AMI of GitLab CE, then upgraded it to the latest version of GitLab. I've gotten everything working, except for one thing: Whenever I reboot the instance in EC2, my /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb's external_url is reset to the IP address of my VPC's SNAT instance, almost as if GitLab is asking \"what is my public IP?\" and then changing the setting's value to that answer. I keep changing it back to the internal hostname provided by my VPC's Route 53 hosted zone, https://gitlab.corp.mydomain.com, but it's reset every time I reboot the instance. To be clear, this GitLab instance is not exposed to the internet, but it does have egress to the internet through the SNAT (e.g., to update OS packages).\nHow can I force my internal hostname to stick? I can still access GitLab through my browser at https://gitlab.corp.mydomain.com, so perhaps this doesn't matter?\n\nA: After a quick search I have found this. \nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/2021\nSummary of the content:\nIt seems like Gitlabs hostname detection is not working correctly if public IPs are deactivated in EC2. To enable usage in such cases Gitlab replaces the hostname with the assigned IP. Gitlab will return to the hostname if it can resolve it later, at least from version 10"
